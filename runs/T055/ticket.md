# T055 — Add secure TV device pairing and remote playback command channel

**Source**: GitHub Issue #104

## Description

## Objective

Add the backend/device foundation that lets an IPTVFlix Android TV app pair securely with the current single-user account and receive remote playback commands from the Web app.

## Product intent

The Android TV client should remain simple. Browsing/choosing content can happen on phone/desktop Web, while the TV acts as a trusted playback target. A user should be able to pair the TV once, then choose a Movie/Episode on Web and send it to that TV.

## Included

- Add a first-class `Device` / playback-target model scoped to the current authenticated IPTVFlix account/profile.
- Implement short-lived TV pairing codes and/or QR-friendly pairing tokens.
- TV can request a pairing code while unauthenticated; an authenticated Web session can approve it.
- After approval, issue a revocable device credential/token suitable for storage on Android TV.
- Add APIs to list, rename and revoke paired devices.
- Add a secure server-side command model for remote playback intents, including at minimum:
  - target device id;
  - canonical Movie/Episode identity;
  - optional explicit Availability id;
  - resume/start position semantics;
  - command id / createdAt / expiry / state.
- Provide a bounded realtime delivery mechanism suitable for Railway + Android TV (WebSocket, SSE/long-poll or equivalent chosen by the Planner) so the TV receives commands quickly without client-to-client direct networking.
- Persist command state enough to survive reconnects/restarts and avoid duplicate playback from the same command.
- Commands must be authenticated/authorized and only deliver to the paired target device.
- Keep provider credentials out of remote-command payloads; the TV should resolve playback through the backend playback boundary from #99.
- Expose device online/last-seen state where practical without requiring a complex presence subsystem.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A fresh TV can display a short pairing code/QR-compatible token without exposing account secrets.
- [ ] An authenticated Web user can approve pairing and the TV receives a durable revocable device credential.
- [ ] Paired devices can be listed, renamed and revoked from Web/API.
- [ ] A remote playback command can target exactly one paired TV.
- [ ] The target TV can receive the command within a few seconds under normal connectivity.
- [ ] Reconnect/retry does not cause the same command to launch repeatedly.
- [ ] Expired/revoked device credentials cannot receive or acknowledge commands.
- [ ] Command payloads contain canonical/playback-resolution references, not raw Xtream/Plex credentials.
- [ ] Automated tests cover pairing approval, invalid/expired code, device revocation, command authorization, delivery and deduplication.

## Excluded / Out of scope

- Android TV UI/player implementation itself.
- Chromecast/Google Cast protocol compatibility.
- Multi-household accounts.
- Remote volume/TV power control.

## Dependencies

Should integrate with #95 hosted authentication and #99 secure playback resolution. The pairing protocol can be developed in parallel while those contracts settle.
