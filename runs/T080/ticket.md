# T080 — Diagnose production Safari/iOS playback failure after compatibility fallback

**Source**: GitHub Issue #170

## Description

## Context
Playback now reaches the player and the Safari/iOS compatibility fallback from T079/#167 executes, but production iPhone Safari still ends with `Impossible de lire ce contenu sur ce navigateur`.

The previous ticket's test report explicitly could not verify the real iPhone/Safari production criterion. This ticket is DIAGNOSTIC ONLY: identify the exact failure in the real production playback path before changing strategy again.

## Goal
Produce a conclusive root-cause diagnosis for one or more real failing imported Xtream Movie/Episode streams on production-like Railway + iPhone Safari.

Do not close this ticket with only unit-test evidence or an architectural assumption. The deliverable is an evidence-backed diagnosis that directly determines the correction ticket.

## Required investigation

### 1. Trace one real playback session end-to-end
For a failing real availability, correlate:
- canonical media id/type;
- availability id;
- source id;
- provider item id;
- stored container extension;
- playback session id;
- original gateway URL;
- compatibility gateway path/mode;
- browser/user agent category.

Never log provider credentials/full secret-bearing Xtream URLs.

### 2. Probe actual upstream media
Run/record ffprobe-equivalent metadata for the real selected upstream stream:
- actual container;
- video codec;
- codec profile/level/pixel format;
- resolution/frame rate;
- audio codec/channels/sample rate;
- duration if VOD;
- whether the upstream response is actually valid media rather than HTML/error/redirect.

### 3. Record compatibility decision
For the failing stream, log which mode `classifyDelivery()` chooses and WHY:
- DIRECT;
- proxy/pass-through;
- REMUX;
- TRANSCODE_AUDIO;
- TRANSCODE_VIDEO;
- other implemented mode.

Include the sanitized probe inputs that produced that decision.

### 4. Inspect ffmpeg execution
When fallback uses ffmpeg/remux/transcode, capture sanitized diagnostics:
- exact mode;
- sanitized ffmpeg arguments (input secret removed/masked);
- process spawn success/failure;
- exit code/signal;
- relevant stderr tail;
- time until first output bytes;
- whether ffmpeg remains alive until client disconnect;
- whether Railway kills it for resource/runtime reasons.

### 5. Validate HTTP response delivered to Safari
For BOTH original gateway and compat gateway, inspect:
- HTTP status;
- Content-Type;
- Content-Length / chunked transfer behavior;
- Accept-Ranges / Content-Range behavior;
- caching headers where relevant;
- first bytes/signature of output;
- whether response terminates prematurely;
- whether redirects occur;
- whether browser receives fMP4/MP4/HLS/TS/etc. matching the advertised MIME type.

### 6. Validate generated media outside the app
Take the compat output for the same real stream and determine whether it is independently playable/valid using suitable media inspection/player tooling. This distinguishes frontend integration failure from invalid gateway output.

### 7. Safari-specific evidence
Capture browser media error details available from the video element:
- MediaError code;
- readyState/networkState;
- source URL mode (normal vs compat);
- relevant events (`loadedmetadata`, `canplay`, `stalled`, `error`, etc.).

Add temporary safe diagnostic telemetry if necessary, but do not expose secrets.

### 8. Check deployment prerequisites
Verify in the ACTUAL Railway API deployment:
- ffmpeg exists;
- ffprobe exists;
- expected versions;
- nixpacks/build config is actually used;
- CPU/RAM/disk/temp-dir constraints;
- no missing executable/path/config mismatch between tests and production.

### 9. Test more than one representative stream
At minimum diagnose:
- the currently failing real iPhone case;
- one known/simple MP4 H.264/AAC availability if present;
- one availability requiring compat/remux if present.

This will reveal whether failure is universal or format-specific.

## Deliverable
Commit a diagnostic report under the ticket run artifacts containing:
- exact failing stage;
- observed upstream media metadata;
- selected compatibility mode;
- observed gateway/ffmpeg behavior;
- Safari-visible error;
- root cause;
- recommended correction with concrete code/components involved.

Do NOT implement a broad speculative fix in this ticket unless a tiny instrumentation fix is required to obtain evidence.

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] A real production-like failing iPhone/Safari stream has been traced end-to-end.
- [ ] Actual upstream container/codecs are known.
- [ ] Actual compatibility mode selected is known and justified.
- [ ] ffmpeg/remux/transcode execution result is known when used.
- [ ] Actual HTTP/MIME/output delivered by compat gateway is known.
- [ ] It is known whether generated compat output is itself valid media.
- [ ] Safari media error/event evidence is captured.
- [ ] Railway ffmpeg/ffprobe deployment is verified, not assumed.
- [ ] Root cause is stated unambiguously with evidence.
- [ ] A concrete correction plan exists for the follow-up issue.
- [ ] Ticket is NOT marked complete merely because automated compatibility unit tests pass.

## Related
Follow-up to #167 / T079. The correction should be implemented in a separate ticket based on this diagnosis.
